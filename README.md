## Why another PDP11/70 project to run an emulated replica?
Just because the PDP11 series of computers built by DEC (Digital Equipment Cooperation) in the 1970s had a significant impact due to their role in the development of UNIX and the programming language C.  
As a 16-bit minicomputer it laid the groundwork for todays CPU designs.  
The PDP11/70 variant has been launched in 1975 running a 5 MHz CPU including an MMU able to address 8 MB of memory.  

**This project is simply combining the great work of the following developers:**
- JÃ¶rg Hoppe who developed the SIMH Realcons extensions and the JAVA panels [3][4]  
- Oscar Vermeulen who offers a real hardware replica of the PDP11/70 panel [5][6] and curated a number of operating systems [14][15][16][17]  
- The SIMH team who developed emulators for important computer systems like the PDP [7][8]  

**Supported target platforms to run the emulation:**
- Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 24)
- Raspberry PI (tested on a model 2 running a 32Bit Rasbian)  


## Download source code from Github and installation
```
$ git clone "https://github.com/shotto42/PDP11_Emulator"
$ cd pidp11/src					# Go into the src directory
$ ./install_dependencies.sh			# Install all required dependencies
$ ./install_pdp11_operating_systems.sh		# Install the operating systems curated by Oscar Vermeulen
$ ./make_simh.sh				# Compile the SIMH including REALCONS extensions
$ ./make_panel.sh				# Compile the JAVA based PDP panels
```


## Run the PDP11/70 Panel and the SIMH Emulator
```
$ cd pidp11					# Go into the main directory
$ ./start_panel.sh				# The PDP11/70 panel needs to be startet before the emulator
$ ./start_pdp11.sh <operating system>		# Start the emulator (e.g. using the 211bsd operating system)
```

## Raspberry PI configuration to establish a remote connection
```
$ sudo raspi-config
Interface Options -> SSH			# Activate SSH when the system is used without keyboard and HDMI monitor
Interface Options -> VNC			# Activate VNC when the Real VNC Viewer [22] is used to access the Raspberry PI desktop
Advanced Options -> A1 Expand Filesystem	# Make sure that the whole SD card is used for the Rasbian OS
Advanced Options -> A6 Wayland -> W1 X11	# Activate X11 to enable the app GUI forwarding via SSH (e.g. MobaXterm [21])
```

## Documentation, Tutorials and Software
- bitsaver.org archieved interesting PDP11/70 documents from manuals to detailed schematics [9][10]
- learningpdp11.com provides a lot of interesting blog posts to learn more about the operations of the PDP11 [12]
- dave.cheney.net has an interesting article covering the PDP11 inventions and architecture [13]
- PDP11 software is archieved by bitsaver.org [11]
- Another PDP11/70 emulator (web based) by Paul Nankervis can be found here [18]


## SIMH Commands
For the full SIMH documentation go to [19]  
PDP11 specific SIMH configuration documentation can be found here [20]

A couple of simple SIMH commands to manage the PDP11/70 emulator on its internal command line:

| OS						| Description                                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| CTRL-E					| Enter the SIMH command line                           |
| CONTINUE                  | Continue the emulation of the machine                 |
| EXIT                      | Leave the emulator                                    |


## Fix in case of RPCBIND issues
```
$ sudo systemctl enable rpcbind
$ sudo systemctl start rpcbind
$ sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip /usr/sbin/rpcbind
```
