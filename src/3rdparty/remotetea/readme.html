<h1>README</h1>

<p>The whole release shebang is summarized in our <a
href="changelog.html">Change Log</a>.<p>

<p>As always, the most current information about the Remote Tea Java
Library, as well as updates, can be found on the web at the <a
class="ext" href="http://remotetea.sourceforge.net">Remote Tea ONC/RPC
Home Page</a>.</p>


<h2>Licensing</h2>

<p>The Remote Tea Java Library is licensed under the terms of the
<a href="Copying.lib">GNU Library General Public License</a> (LGPL).</p>

<p>Rationale: while the LGPL does not restrict the use of my packages
even in commercial applications, I am ensuring this way that
modifications to the source code <em>must</em> be given back to the
comunity. If you use my packages in commercial applications, you must
either include the source code of the Remote Tea ONC/RPC Java Library
or provide the source code to your customers on request. The details
can be found in the <a href="Copying.lib">LGPL terms</a>.</p>


<h2>Project Structure</h2>

<p>The directory structure is as follows. Due to the transition to the
Eclipse IDE and Ant not everything is currently in place and perfect
shape.</p>

<ul>

  <li><span><code>javadoc/</code>: <a href="javadoc/index.html">Remote Tea
  ONC/RPC documentation</a></span></li>

  <li><span><code>src/</code>: source code of the Remote Tea ONC/RPC
  Java Library.

  <ul>

    <li><span><code>src/org/acplt/oncrpc</code> contains the source
    code of the various packages.</span></li>

    <li><span><code>src/org/acplt/oncrpc/apps</code> contains
    applications, in this case only the <span
    class="product">jrpcgen</span> rpc protocol compiler in the
    <code>jrpcgen/</code> subdirectory.</span></li>

    <li><span><code>src/tests</code> contains test code.</span></li>

    <li><span><code>src/tests/org/acplt/oncrpc/jrpcgen</code> contains
    an example of how to use the <code>jrpcgen</code> rpc protocol
    compiler. To generate source code from the x-file, run:

    <pre>
  java -jar jrpcgen.jar -p tests.org.acplt.oncrpc.jrpcgen -nobackup demo.x
    </pre>
    </span></li>

  </ul>
  </span></li>

  <li><span><code>classes/</code>: will receive the compiled Java
  bytecode. After running the Ant <code>build.xml</code> makefile with
  target <q>jar</q>, this directory will also contain two jar files
  called <code>classes/oncrpc.jar</code> and
  <code>classes/jrpcgen.jar</code>.</span></li>

</ul>

<p>The <q>Remote Tea</q> ONC/RPC Java package is currently being
developed and tested using Eclipse on a JDK&nbsp;1.4.2 (Windows).</p>

<p>Those who like to compile the sources by themselves might want to
use either the Eclipse <code>.project</code> file or the Ant makefile
<code>build.xml</code> (this is not really functional yet), both are
located in the root directory of this package.</p>


<h2>Who's to blame</h2>

<p>The <q>Remote Tea</q> Java Package has been written by Harald
Albrecht (<a class="ext"
href="mailto:harald@plt.rwth-aachen.de">harald@plt.rwth-aachen.de</a>).
