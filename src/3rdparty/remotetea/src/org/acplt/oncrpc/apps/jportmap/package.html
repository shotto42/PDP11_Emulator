Java-based portmap

<p>This package implements a Java-based ONC/RPC portmap compatible with
Sun's portmap, protocol version 2.

<p>In case you really do not want to use a native portmap designed for
your particular operating system, you can use <code>jportmap</code> as
a substitute (nod, nod...). I must be (beep) writing a Java-based portmap.

<p>There is also an embeddable portmap service available as class
<code><a href="OncRpcEmbeddedPortmap.html">OncRpcEmbeddedPortmap</a></code>.
This can be used to make sure that a portmap service is always available, even
if the operating system does not provide one or it is not installed or not
enabled.
