jrpcgen for ONC/RPC Java package.

<p>This package provides a Java-based rpcgen RPC protocol
compiler called "jrpcgen". jrpcgen is a Java-based tool that generates
source code of Java classes to implement an RPC protocol. The input to
jrpcgen is a language similiar to C (but more probably much more similiar
to FORTRAN) known as the RPC language (Remote Procedure Call Language).
Because the files containing RPC language are typically tagged with ".x"
they are called "x-files" throughout this documentation.

<p><b>Usage:</b>

<p><code>jrpcgen</code> [<code>-</code><i>options</i>] <i>x-file</i>

<p>where options include:

<dl>
<dt><code>-c</code> <i>classname</i></dt>
   <dd>Specify class name of client proxy stub.
   </dd>
<dt><code>-d</code> <i>directory</i></dt>
  <dd>Specify directory where to place generated class source code files.
  </dd>
<dt><code>-p</code> <i>package name</i> or <code>-package</code> <i>package name</i><dt>
  <dd>Specify package name for generated source code files.
  </dd>
<dt><code>-s</code> <i>classname</i></dt>
   <dd>Specify class name of server proxy stub.
   </dd>
<dt><code>-ser</code></dt>
  <dd>tag classes generated for XDR structs, XDR unions and XDR typedefs as
  serializable. Also automatically generates <code>serialVersionUID</code>
  using the SHA-1 algorithm.
  </dd>
<dt><code>-bean</code></dt>
  <dd>generate accessors for usage as bean, implies <code>-ser</code>.
  </dd>
<dt><code>-noclamp</code></dt>
  <dd>do not clamp version number in client method stubs.
  </dd>
<dt><code>-initstrings</code></dt>
  <dd>automatically initialize all <code>Strings</code> as empty strings ("").
  Note that this may lead to lazy programming; better make explicitly sure
  that every member of a struct gets initialized properly before encoding the
  struct.
  </dd>
<dt><code>-nobackup</code></dt>
  <dd>Do not make backups of old source code files for which new source code
  is generated.
  </dd>
<dt><code>-noclient</code></dt>
  <dd>Do not create source code for the client proxy stub.
  </dd>
<dt><code>-noserver</code></dt>
  <dd>Do not create source code for the server proxy stub.
  </dd>
<dt><code>-parseonly</code></dt>
  <dd>Parse x-file only but do not generate source code files.
  </dd>
<dt><code>-verbose</code></dt>
  <dd>Enable verbose output about what the jrpcgen compiler is doing.
  </dd>
<dt><code>-version</code></dt>
  <dd>Print jrpcgen version.
  </dd>
<dt><code>-?</code> or <code>-help</code></dt>
  <dd>Print this help.
  </dd>
<dt><code>--</code></dt>
  <dd>End options.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p><b>Notes</b>

<p>To cite the man pages for rpcgen(1):
<i>The RPC Language does not support nesting of structures.
As a work-around, structures can be declared at the top-level,
and their name used inside other structures in order to achieve
the same effect. Name clashes can occur when using program
definitions, since the apparent scoping does not really apply. Most
of these can be avoided by giving unique names for programs, versions,
procedures, and types.</i> And I thought that the RFC was written
before rpcgen to reflect reality but not wishes for further development.

<p>jrpcgen can process the same x-files as its SunOS4.1-based rpcgen
counterpart. Or at least it should. The Java language as well as the
Java environment cause some slight differences in the code generated
with respect to the typical C code emitted by rpcgen. Please also
refer to the <code>demo.x</code> example in
<code>tests.org.acplt.oncrpc.jrpcgen</code> for the inner details.

<p>However, <code>jrpcgen</code> currently does not support C preprocessor
directives, as <code>rpcgen</code> does my running <code>cpp</code> first
on the x-file. If you need to achieve the same effect, first run
<code>cpp</code> by hand (pardon: makefile) and pipe the result into
<code>jrpcgen</code>.

<ul>
<li><p>All global constants are put into one public interface with the
same name as the x-file. Global constants are constants either defined
using "const" or program and version constants. If a x-file named
<code>demo.x</code> defines a constant <code>FOO</code>, then its
Java counterpart will be accessible as <code>demo.FOO</code>.</p>

<li><p>All enumeration members of a particular enumeration are put into a
public interface with the same name as the enumeration. For example:
<code>enum FOO { foo };</code> results in a public <code>interface FOO</code>
with a <code>public static final int foo</code>. The enumeration members
are accessed like <code>FOO.foo</code>. Within the generated Java code,
wherever the enumeration type is used, a Java base data type of
<code>int</code> is used instead to avoid cluttering the code.</p>

<li><p>For each typedef the jrpcgen protocol compiler emits a class source file
of the same name. For instance, <code>typedef string STRING<>;</code> results
in <code>class STRING</code>. Such classes always contain exactly one attribute
named <code>value</code>. This attribute is of the same type as specified
in the typedef, that is <code>String</code> (Java base type) in our case.</p>

<li><p>For each struct the protocol compiler also emits a class source file
of the same name, containing the specified attributes.</p>

<li><p>The server stub code contains the dispatcher code and defines each
remote procedure specified in the x-file as abstract. You need to supply
your own implementation for each one of these stubs. Note that RPC base
data types like int, u_long, etc. are mapped to their appropriate
Java base type counterparts (int, int, in this example).</p>

<p>By default, the server stub class is named after the x-file but with
<code>ServerStub</code> appended. For example, if the x-file is named
<code>demo.x</code>, then the server stub class is <code>demoServerStub</code>.</p>

<li><p>The client stub/proxy implements the remote procedures specified in
the x-file as local methods which will call their remote counterpart on
an ONC/RPC server.</p>

<p>By default, the client stub class is named after the x-file but with
<code>Client</code> appended. For example, if the x-file is named
<code>demo.x</code>, then the client class is <code>demoClient</code>.</p>

</ul>
