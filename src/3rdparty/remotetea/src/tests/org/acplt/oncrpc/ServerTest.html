<p><hr>

This example demonstrates how to write a simple ONC/RPC server. It registers
an ONC/PRC program (number 0x49679) and accepts calls over TCP/IP and UDP/IP.
To stop the server you should send it a call for program #42, procedure #42
with version #42. For this you should use the <code>rpcinfo</code> command
line utility coming with your favourite ONC/RPC distribution.
